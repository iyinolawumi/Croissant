        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin. 
        named for its historical crescent shape. It is made from a layered yeast leavened dough.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several
        times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
        flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
        
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The
        modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
        with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        
        In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that
        could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
        patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
        
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
